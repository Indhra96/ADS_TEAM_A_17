The punctuality of airline operations, often gauged through On-Time Performance 
(OTP), is a pivotal concern in the aviation industry. OTP is typically defined as the 
percentage of flights experiencing delays exceeding 14 minutes upon gate arrival. 
These delays can be attributed to various intricate factors, such as Turn Delay (onground), Block Delay (in-air), and Previous Delay carried over from prior flight legs. 
This project focuses on an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) approach, 
which involves dissecting flight arrival delays into these three distinct components. 
Rather than analyzing the overall OTP or Arrival Delay, this approach promises to 
provide a more detailed and insightful perspective on the factors influencing airline 
punctuality. The dataset used for this analysis is drawn from the Department of 
Transport and covers flight-level OTP data for multiple airlines. Through this 
specialized EDA, we aim to unravel the complex web of influences on flight delays. 
This project serves to benefit both airlines and passengers. Airlines can gain valuable 
insights into the operational aspects that impact their OTP, allowing them to enhance 
service quality and efficiency. For passengers, a better understanding of the factors 
contributing to delays can lead to more informed travel decisions. In this abstract, we 
provide an overview of the approach and methodology that will be applied in the 
subsequent sections, demonstrating the potential of this analysis to improve the 
overall airline travel experience.
